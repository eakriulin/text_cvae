# Text generation with CVAE

This project explores generating synthetic restaurant reviews, conditioned on a given star rating (1 to 5), using CVAEs (Conditonal Variational Autoencoders). I implemented an LSTM encoder-decoder architecture and trained it on a small-scale dataset. Even with this toy setup, the model produces reviews that are quite good and often logically sound.

This project can be run on Google Colab â€” no additonal setup needed! Training is quick, so you'll be able to see the results fast.
